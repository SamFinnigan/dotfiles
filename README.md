# sjmf/dotfiles
Personal collection of dotfiles used on systems running GNU/Linux

This is a convenience repository for when I need to get up-and-running on a new Linux box. You're quite welcome to try out these dotfiles- I've included a script `./makesymlinks.sh` which symlinks the dotfiles into the home directory and backs up the old ones into a `~/dotfiles_old/` directory.

The files will include bits of other peoples' dotfiles which I've pulled in from elsewhere but forgotten where I got them, they were kicking about for a few years before I hit upon the idea of putting them in git. Sadly, I've not got time right now to trawl Google to find out where they came from.
